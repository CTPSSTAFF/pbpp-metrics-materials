## Notes on Methodology
The formula for calculating the Peak Hour Excessive Delay metrics, as defined by the FHWA is:

> Peak Hour Excessive Delay - ALL PHED during 15-minute increments during peak hours (eventually converted to hours)
> Traffic congestion will be measured by the annual hours of peak hour excessive delay (PHED) per capita on the NHS. 
> Excessive delay will be based on travel time at 20 miles per hour or 60 percent of the posted speed limit travel time, 
> whichever is greater, during in 15-minute intervals per vehicle. https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/tpm/faq.cfm#phed

In order to calculate this metric, for each TMC included in the analysis, we will need:
1. travel time data
2. the 'posted speed limit'

Item \(1\) can be obtained directly from RITIS. Item \(2\2) is a bit more of a challenge.  
Even though MassDOT maintains posted speed limit data \(and 'speed regulation'\) data in the Road Inventory,
this data is stored in 'event tables' which are effectively overlayed on the underlying MassDOT route system.
The challenge here is that the relevant event tables do not segment the underlying route system in the same
way the TMC network does. In other words, the two systems, in general, don't 'line up.' This makes obtaining
the actual speed limit for a TMC \(as needed in these calculations\) less than straightforward.  

Of all the TMCs in the NPMRDS in the Boston MPO region, the majority - 2,767 - are part of the 
Congestion Management Process (\CMP\) TMC network. This is very good news, because as part of the CMP, CTPS
staff conflated the CMP-specific portion of the TMC network with the Road Inventory, and obtained the speed 
limit for each TMC. Athough much of this work was automated the final conflation required manual review and
correction, particulary for TMCs that were not on express highways. For all the TMCs that are part of the
CMP network, we will use the speed limit from the CMP as we have high confidence in its accuracy.

This leaves the question of how to obtain speed limits for the remaining 1,956 TMCs. The methodology we adopted
relies upon the work of a consulting firm, 1spatial.com, that was hired by MassDOT to conflate the full INRIX TMC
network with the MassDOT Road Inventory a year or so ago. This conflation was performed completely programmatically;
no review and correction by humans was invovled. 

As part of the conflation, 1spatial produced an event table / feature class of TMC IDs and the 
associated 'Weighted_Average_SR' - the distance-weighted _speed\_regulation_ for the TMC.

While _speed\_regulation_ isn't identical to _speed\_limit_, Bob Frey of MassDOT's Office of Transportation
Planning has advised CTPS that it should be taken as more authoratative than _speed\_limit_. Consequently,
we will be using this value in the calcuations below to come up with a 'speed limit' for the remaining TMCs.
